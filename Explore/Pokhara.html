            Pokhara’s tranquil beauty has been the subject of inspiration for many travel writers. Its pristine air, spectacular backdrop of snowy peaks, blue lakes and surrounding greenery make it ‘the jewel in the Himalaya’, a place of remarkable natural disposition. With the magnificent Annapurna range forming the backdrop and the serenity of the Cluster of 9 Lakes with three major ones - Phewa, Rupa and Begnas – Pokhara is a great destination for a weekend getaway as well as a long relaxing holiday. Pokhara Valley, gateway to the Annapurna region where many a trekker finds his Shangri-la, sits high on the list of ‘must visit’ places in Nepal.
    
             Pokhara once lay on the important trade route between India and Tibet. To this day, mule trains set up camps on the city outskirts, bringing goods from remote Himalayan regions including Mustang. Gurungs and Magars, who have earned world-wide fame as fierce Gurkha warriors, are predominant here. Thakalis, indigenous of the Thak Khola region of Mustang, are known for their entrepreneurship and run tea houses along the trek routes in the Annapurna region. The Pokhara is best known for the stunning view of the Annapurna range. It is perhaps one of the few places on earth from where mountains above 6,000 m can be seen unobstructed from an altitude of 800 m within the distance of 28 km.

                </div>
                <p>Pokhara owes much its popularity to the enchanting fresh-water Cluster of 9 Lakes which include the popular Phewa,  Begnas, Rupa, Khaste, Dipang, Maidi, Gunde, Neurani, Kamalpokhari and Pokhara Seti Catchment, lakes. The lakes give Pokhara its name and also play a vital role in sustaining the biodiversity, ecosystem and the local livelihood. The Pokhara Valley Lake Cluster was listed as Ramsar Site on Feb. 2, 2021. 

                    On the eastern shore of Phewa Lake is Lakeside or Baidam, a thriving resort town of hotels, restaurants, bars and souvenir shops popular among travelers. Phewa Lake is a great place to relax with various leisure and water activities. Boaters usually also make it a point to visit Taal Barahi Temple dedicated to Ajima or Shakti, on a little strip of island in Phewa Lake. Equally popular are the Begnas and Rupa lakes which are a little out of town and offer refreshing breaks from the city humdrum. Boats can be hired in the lake vicinities. </p>

                </div>
                <p>The limestone caves of Mahendra Gupha full of interesting features of stalactites and stalagmites are believed to have formed during the Pleistocene epoch (the Great Ice Age).  Located about 8 km north of Pokhara and locally known as the House of Bats, the caves were accidentally discovered in 1950s by young shepherds. Named after Late King Mahendra, the caves were studied for the first time by a team of speliologists from the United Kingdom in 1976, the report of which resides with the UK copyright libraries and Royal Geographical Society. </p>

                <p>The World Peace Pagoda can be seen on top of a hill on the southern fringe of Phewa Lake. It has four images of the Buddha facing the four directions. The dome-shaped pagoda is an impressive sight, and its hilltop location commands a great view. It is a great vantage point which offers spectacular views of the Annapurna. Near the Peace Pagoda are Pumdi and Bumdi, two villages above Phewa Lake's southern rim for exceptional views of the mountains.  They have the old style oval-shaped, red clay houses.  </p>
